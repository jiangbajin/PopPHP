Welcome to the Pop PHP Framework 1.7.0 Release!
===============================================

RELEASE INFORMATION
-------------------
Pop PHP Framework 1.7.0 Release  
Released December 1, 2013

OVERVIEW
--------
The Pop PHP Framework is a robust, yet easy-to-use PHP framework
with a verbose API. It supports PHP 5.3+.

The beginnings of this framework were humble. Originally containing only
9 components, the focus was placed in simplicity and being lightweight.
It attempted to provide solutions in areas such as graphics and images,
which were found lacking (or completely ignored) in other frameworks
and libraries.

Today, the Pop PHP Framework maintains its simplicity and is still
lightweight. And, even though many new features have been built in,
the framework can still easily be used as merely a toolbox, or as a
major framework for the foundation of your applications.

To see a list of the new and vastly improved features in the framework,
view the CHANGELOG.md file.

following versions of the required software:

Any variation in the versions of the required software may contribute to the
